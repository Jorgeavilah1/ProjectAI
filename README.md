# AI VIDEOGAMES AGENT

AI VIDEOGAMES AGENT is a Python Intial AI project developed in phyton with statistical, machine learning and AI libraries (Pandas, Tensorflow, numpy, scikit-learn). Most of the code is
done following an AI Introductory Course in UDEMY called "Artificial Intelligence A-Z".
The purpose of the proyect is to create multiple agents using Deep Q learning to form efficient Convolutional Neural Networks and Artificial Neural Networks able to perform certain game tasks
(Play Doom, Self Drivin Car) all while learning from each time the agent plays.
